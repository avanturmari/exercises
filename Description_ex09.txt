Use a convolutional network with overall structure:Ê(1-2 * convolution layers; pooling layer) * 1-3dense layer * 1-2softmaxto train a network to classify fashion MNIST data set (it is available in keras datasets collection). Analyse model performance; can you beat your dense network performance?
