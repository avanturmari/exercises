Assignment: Exercise 08: Fashion-mnist classificationThe traditional MNIST dataset is considered to be too easy to be used as a case for evaluating model performance. A new dataset with more complex images has been made available and is getting popular. See https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist for details about the data set.Download fashion-mnist and train a sequential dense model for it (note that fashion MNIST is available in keras.datasets like the original MNIST). Make sure to study the the data, plot some images from it etc. to get familiar with the data set. Compare the accuracy you achieve vs. the accuracy achieved in standard mnist example. Analyze model behaviour by plotting loss/accuracy diagrams and confusion matrix.Note: deep doesn’t mean 100’s of layers. Start with small network. Please return your solution as a notebook that contains the needed code, explanations, graphs, and YOUR NAME and student id.
