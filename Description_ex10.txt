Please note that this example runs on tensorflow < 2.0 without major modifications. So as not to force people to spend time downgrading their sw, this is now extra assignment.Try vae example inhttps://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks/blob/master/8.4-generating-images-with-vaes.ipynbwith fashion-mnist images. Do you get a sensible continuous distribution?
